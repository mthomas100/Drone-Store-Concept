# Project Description 

I wanted take a figma design file and translate into a functional and responsive prototype built from scratch.
The figma project (which I am not the owner of nor am I affiliated with) that I used can be found below
https://www.figma.com/file/f2w8SKnEDb7gOpDYCcv7C1/BWA-Wordpress-Community?node-id=0%3A1
I accomplished building this project taking a full stack approach involving as the main technologies [Strapi](https://strapi.com/)for the Backend and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the Frontend. **__Presently this application is only composed of the home page (adding dynamic product routes is planned for a future updated__**

Some secondary goals of this project were to improve my proficiency in TypeScript and to learn the CSS framework tailwindcss, in addition to building on my knowledge of graphql, nextjs, and strapi. 

# superplate

>[Superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate) is a well-structured production-ready frontend boilerplate with Typescript, Jest, testing-library, styled-component, Sass, Css, .env, Fetch, Axios, Reverse Proxy, >Bundle Analyzer and 30+ plugin. For now, only creates projects for React and Next.js

The boilerplate for this project was generated with [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate).
The superplate CLI helped me generate a nextJS project that included apollo client, styled components, tailwindcss, typescript capable linting configurations, as well as bundling in some helpful libraries such as react-use. I find that time spent configuring these technologies can often detract from the developer experience. As the goal with this project was to quickly bootstrap itand spend more time developing than configuring, this was a natural choice. 

# Typescript 

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale.

This is the second project I have used typescript for. My main interest in using it here was to learn how to generate types for graphql queries. This was accomplished by using the [graphql code generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/). This allowed me to take my graphql schema generated by strapi and get the appropriate types for it. Then when I used data from my graphql api as props, the types allowed me to access every property of every object queried from bmy strapi backend. The learning process was a little rough but as a result of it I feel my powers as a developer are greatly enhanced. I'm looking forward to using this tech on a bigger project, where the utility of this kind of tech will really shine.

# TailwindCSS

>A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
>[Go To Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

This was my first project using tailwindCSS. It is known for being a highly effective css technology with the drawback of having html with a large amount of class names. Despite this drawback, I still found it much easier read and to develop responsive designs than with any technology that I have used previously (such as bootstrap, material UI, and styled components). Were I to develop this app further I could easily see clearing this issue up by defining custom tailwind classes that are composed of several individual classes, in addition to further abstracting code into React components where necessary.  

# NextJS

> "The React Framework for Production" [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

Next.js is by far the most exciting tech to come to the web development scene in recent times. Its page based routing system and ability to easily switch between server side rendering, static generation, incremental static generation, etc. make it a powerful tool for any react developer. In this project I used its static generation capabilities, as it has no real dynamic data. In theory if this project were used to bootstrap a live app, a combination of these rendering modes would be used where it necessary. 

The main reason why static generation was chosen was to avoid the pitfalls that often come with hosting applications on the cheap. Heroku, where I chose to host my backend goes to sleep after a rather short time interval. This means that when someone tries to access the site after a while in which it was not accessed, they will be forced to wait several seconds for the dyno to boot up and load the page. With static generation I only need to hit the heroku (strapi) api once at build time. What about updating site content? There is a build hook enabled through strapi that triggers a rebuild of the statically generated next.js app. It takes a couple minutes for the site to go live after the changes are published by the site admin. Beyond this build time caveat, static generation is a loved feature because of how fast loads and how well it performs for users of the site. 

In a future ecommerce application I am to allow for the best of both worlds. The admin's preview page would be rendered live via server side rendering whereas the side of the app that the public sees would be statically gnerated. Such is the benefit of next.JS
